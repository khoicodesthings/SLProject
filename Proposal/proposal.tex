For our SL project, we want to build a few models to predict a user's preference for a song on Spotify. 

Each song on Spotify have their own set of 11 features. These features are: danceability, energy, key, loudness,
mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, and tempo.

A user can request their streaming history from Spotify via the $Privacy$ section of their account. For the purpose
of this project, Khoi's one-year streaming history from February 2022 to February 2023 will be used as the $1$ class, for songs we like; and about
4200 random songs which Khoi has never heard will be used as the $0$ class, for songs we do not like.

The dataset will have 56,210 songs in class $1$, and 4,170 songs in class $0$. However, the songs in class $1$ have duplicates, due to the nature of streaming
a song multiple times. We expect this number will be much lower once the duplicates are removed. We anticipate around $2000$ songs in class $1$ at the end of the day.

Our current hypothesis is that our supervised learning models will be able to classified these songs as likes or dislikes with at least 90\% accuracy. To this end,
Airi will implement Naive Bayes and Random Forests; while Khoi will implement Logistics Regression and Decision Trees.
