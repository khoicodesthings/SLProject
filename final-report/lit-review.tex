\section{Brief Overview}

In this section, some brief overview will be given for the data, as well as some pre-processing and analysis.

One thing we wanted to explore from the data, is how the points are related to one another, through principal component analysis, and clustering. Using k-means clustering, with $k = 3$, we obtained the following figure.

Looking at the figure, we can see that Principal Component 1 separate songs with higher valence, key, danceability (these mostly belong to Cluster 1), and Principal Component 2 separate songs with higher acousticness, speechiness, and liveness (these mostly belong to Cluster 0).
