\section{Hypotheses}
Our first hypothesis is that our supervised learning models will be able to classified these songs as likes or dislikes with at least 90\% accuracy.

Our second hypothesis is that out of the four chosen algorithms; Random Forest will give us the best performance; followed by Decision Tree, then Logistic Regression, and finally Naive Bayes. We will evaluate each algorithm's performance by comparing the value of Precision, Recall, and produce ROC curves for each algorithm.
