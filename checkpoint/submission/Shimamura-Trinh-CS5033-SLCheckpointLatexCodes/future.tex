\section{Future Work}

Khoi will continue refining his logistic regression model, as well as work on the decision tree model. The decision tree model will be useful for random forest, as well.

To enhance the performance of the random forest and Naive Bayes models, Airi will continue re-evaluating them and obtain ROC curves. Moreover, she will expand the random forest model by increasing the number of trees and maximum depth for each tree. In addition, she will experiment with two other criteria, namely entropy and chi-squared, to assess their impact on the model's performance.

Finally, as mentioned in the previous section, the Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest models will need to be redone, to ensure accurate performance.
