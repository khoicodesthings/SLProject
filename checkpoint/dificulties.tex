\section{Difficulties Encountered}

The ROC curves for the Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest are all straight lines, which indicates the models cannot identify any relevant patterns or features, so either the data processing or the models need to be re-evaluated.

Moreover, Naive Bayes performance is much better than Logistic Regression; so both of these models will need to be reevaluated.
